# The Wild Oasis üå≤ (for online guests)

The Wild Oasis (for online guests) is a web application that allows online users to explore and book cabins. This is a demo version for educational purposes based on [**The Ultimate Reacty.js**](https://shorturl.at/m3qIS) course on **Udemy** by [**Jonas Schmedtmann**](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/).

Click here to visit the [live demo](https://wild-oasis-home-stay.vercel.app/) of this application deployed on Vercel.
Besides, there is another application with the same name also called **The Wild Oasis**, but it's a completely different project made for hotel staff to manage the same hotel of this application.

## Implementation üõ†Ô∏è

This section provides an overview of the key implementations and functionalities developed in this project.

### 1. User Authentication

- **NextAuth.js** is used to handle user authentication.
- Users can log in using their Google accounts.
- Secure authentication ensures user data is protected.

### 2. Cabin Browsing

- Users can browse through a list of available cabins.
- Each cabin displays detailed information including images, descriptions, and pricing.
- The cabin data is fetched from a mock API for demonstration purposes.

### 3. Booking System

- Users can book cabins directly through the application.
- The booking process is streamlined to be quick and user-friendly.
- Booking data is stored in a mock database for demonstration purposes.

### 4. Responsive Design

- The application is designed to be fully responsive.
- It provides an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.

### 5. Server-Side Rendering

- **Next.js** is used to implement server-side rendering.
- This improves the performance and SEO of the application by pre-rendering pages on the server.

### 6. State Management

- **React.js** is used for building the user interface.
- State management is handled using React's built-in hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect`.

### 7. Environment Configuration

- Environment variables are used to manage sensitive information such as API keys and authentication secrets.
- A `.env` file is used to store these variables securely.

### 8. Deployment

- The application is deployed on Vercel.
- Continuous deployment is set up to automatically deploy changes pushed to the main branch.

This project demonstrates a full-stack web application with a focus on user authentication, booking functionality, and responsive design.
